# Tobi-Gamewear-Stores
It is a project where I put most of my html and CSS knowledge to make a Game accessories page that is fully responsive
It's A fairly basic project and the hover effect is basic increase of width and transition functions
Any suggestions Would Be Welcomed
I'm A javascript beginner so the code may seem fairly long,i Don't know a shorter method yet
Languages Used include
HTML5
CSS3
Javascript
